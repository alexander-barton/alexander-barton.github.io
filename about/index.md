## Professional stuff

My background is in neuroscience and I have written a [master's thesis](../assets/ThesisM.pdf) under the tutelage of [Jens Pruessner](https://psychologie.uni-konstanz.de/pruessner/) at McGill.  The focus was on autonomic-HPA interaction during a stress task.  I wrote some [Java software](https://github.com/alexander-barton/MIST) for said task.

Following this I worked as a research assistant at the University of Calgary under [Brad Goodyear](https://www.ucalgary.ca/seaman-family-magnetic-resonance/).  I processed reams of MRI data for the [A-CAP project](https://www.ctrc-ccrt.ca/projects/advancing-concussion-assessment-in-children-a-cap/), among other things.

Most recently I have completed an MEng in ECE at the University of Toronto, emphases in Communications & Analytics.  The goal was to beef-up my bona fides in statistical learning, applied ML, and -- suprisingly -- financial modeling.

My [CV](../cv/index.html) and [github page](https://www.github.com/alexander-barton?tab=repositories) can be found at their respective links.

## Research stuff

Apropos of research interests I wish to better understand the underlying computational & algorithmic structure of the brain.  Over the last six years this has veered from the highly specific (a focus on heart rate variability as a signal for the ANS) to the grossly broad (resting state networks in fMRI).
